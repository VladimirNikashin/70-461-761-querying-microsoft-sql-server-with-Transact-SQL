We start off with check constraints in file 83, so check constraints are basically data limiters, 
it make sure that we cant input data that exceeds the limit of the check constraint.

Primary and Foreign Keys like the ones in file 90 and 91 are sort of a constraint to make sure that the value known as ID stays unique.
It prevents duplicate ID variables from existing in the table.

I see views like Pseudo tables that represent calculated results and views are created in file 94 for that reason.

In file 104 We are implementing AFTER Trigger, So when Something gets inserted or deleted we can Trigger an output event which is exactly what we did.

In file 105 the Instead Trigger is acvtivated when inserting or deleting something. Instead of deleting It will begin 
a different transaction and something else will occur in its place.

In file 107 and its extras we just look at basic Control flow with the UPDATE Statement.
