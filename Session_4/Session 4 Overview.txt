In file 116 at INTERSECT and EXCEPT we just look at an example of what they do.
INTERSECT does this: Brings back anything that exists in the second table that deos not exist in the first table 
EXCEPT does this: Brings back anything that exists in both tables

In 117 and 117+ I implemented SQL Switches. So when My variable equals 'Option A' then output 'First Option'

In 120 and 121 we look at brief examples of merge by using MATCHED and NOT MATHCED.

In 122 a more complex query is built from matched that explains DML(Data Manipulation Language) honestly 
I do not understand the full workings of this specific query or what the full aim of it is. 
And therefore I am unable to provide a proper description of this particular file.

In 124 We are creating a Procedure. So basically a procedure is this: Instead of writing a 
SELECT over and over a person can just write one query and execute it with something like 

NameEmployees 4
EXECUTE NameEmployees 223
EXEC NameEmployees 323

It saves time.

In 126 we just look at different variations of how one can implement the Function IF EXISTS.

In 128 and 129 we look at how While loops are implemented in SQL with regards to procedures.

In 132 and 134 we Look at Error handling and how its handled, I made comments in this file to show a more detailed overview of whats happening.

In 118 we look at the differences between ISNULL and COALESCE, I have made comments that show a more detailed overview of the scenario.

In 115 We look at the differences between UNION and UNION ALL I have made comments that show a more detailed overview of the scenario.
