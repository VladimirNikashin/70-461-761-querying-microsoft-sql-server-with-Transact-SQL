IN 175 we use correlated subquery to improve qeury execution performance. The performance of the query can be seen 
by running the include execution plan inside ssms.

In 178 We take a look at dynamically reusable SQL Query with the HElp of th WITH clause.

185 and 185+ are just examples of what a CTE is, Common Table Expressions.

190 see my comments for a better description of what a multiline table does.

In 189 we return the entire table using inline functions.

In 191 We join tables by using Apply because Join wont work with functions.

In 192 We take a look at an example of a SYNONYM, it take statements turns them into a short word for reference.

In 193 We look at a brief example of dynamic sql and the danger that comes with it.

In 195 we practice serialization by the use of Global unique indentifiers.

In 196 and 197 we create a cycling sequence that increments itself as it goes on and 
upon reaching its max cycle limit it restarts itself counting again from the lowest cycle variable.

227 If a row has been updated 5 years ago and then the row has been updated 
today this shows how to retrieve the historic changes done to that row.
