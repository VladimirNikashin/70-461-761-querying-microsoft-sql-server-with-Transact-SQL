In this session we start on the development of the main database.
In file 58 we look at how to find String parts of a row by using String formatting characters and new Keywords such as LIKE 
with new Key Functions such as >= and = and <>. I have put Comments in the file to further explain in detail what these do in practice.
The Same thing. Different Keywords are used when your parts that you are targetting are Numerical.

Internally Creating tables via Select
So basically we are Making new tables via Select statement.
Inside file 70 Notice the keyword into. That is what we use to make internal tables.

In file 71 I was Joining tables with LEFT JOIN so as my understanding goes we retrieving all the records from the left 
table with all the records from the right table and outputting the results via a select statement.

In 72 I was Joining them now with a right join and additionally we create a derived table that contains an inner select statement.
I would say we are retrieving all records from the right table and unmatched records from the Left table.

In file 73 We Run the Delete Query and we see how ROLLBACK reverses our Transaction.
