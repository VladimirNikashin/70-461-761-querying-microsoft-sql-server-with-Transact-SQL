In 142 We explore what Over is...  OVER() takes a particular range of some rows and it does a calculation based on that number of over those rows.

In 144 We make a total by adding the current NumberAttendance and next row's NumberAttendance it changes based on th number of NumberAttendance.
I have added comments in 144.

in 145 We look at data reading with Current ROW and UNBOUNDED. 
Since there are lots of implementations I have made comments that explains every implementation you can view them in fil 145.

In 146 and 147 WE retrieve Rows based on RANGE and ROW see my comments in 146 and 147 for a further in depth explanation.

In 149 we divide a partition with the use of NTILE().

In 150 we see that the first_value takes the first value of the partition or rows in ORDER BY and the last_value takes the last 
value of the partition or row in ORDER BY

In 151 LAG and LEAD are data reading results that show the numbers that are following up an numbers and numbers that are preceding.

In 158 - 163 We Look at how to make Grids after which we draw points and shapes on them via co-ordinates and strings. 
Be sure to click on Spatial results when running Geometry based transaction.

In 162 We see how to make point based address tables via co ordinates.
